# Background

Media Distributors, Inc. is a Wichita, KY based distributor and seller of films and music for commercial purposes. For the past few years, it has managed its film and music sales separately using different applications. This division is historical as Media Distributors started distributing films and then acquired SoundMania about two years ago. As the two distribution channels were different, CTO Alvin Coelho made the decision not to integrate the SoundMania's information systems and database with those of Media Distributors. This has not been a problem until now, however Media Distributors intends to make itself available for acquisition. To that end, an integrated view of the business, particularly sales, is needed.

This report provides key sales, revenue, and customer metrics to showcase Media Distributors business. The analysis provided is based on data from a custom-built datamart containing data extracted from two operational databases.

# Key Business Metrics

This sections provides key revenue and customer information segmented by time, country, and business unit. Revenue numbers are in US$.

## Sales Revenue

```{r totalRevenue, echo = FALSE}
# get year with most sales and total revenue for that year from both business units
yearWithMostSalesAndTotalRevenueQuery <- "
  SELECT 
      dt.year, 
      SUM(sf.amount) AS total_revenue
  FROM 
      sales_facts sf
  JOIN 
      dim_time dt ON sf.time_key = dt.time_key
  GROUP BY 
      dt.year
  ORDER BY 
      total_revenue DESC
  LIMIT 1;
"

totalRevenueData <- executeQuery(mysqlCon, yearWithMostSalesAndTotalRevenueQuery)
yearWithMostSales <- totalRevenueData$year
totalRevenueOnYearWithMostSales <- dollar(totalRevenueData$total_revenue)

# get country with the most sales and total revenue
countryWithMostSalesAndTotalRevenueQuery <- "
  SELECT 
      dl.country, 
      SUM(sf.amount) AS total_revenue
  FROM 
      sales_facts sf
  JOIN 
      dim_location dl ON sf.location_key = dl.location_key
  GROUP BY 
      dl.country
  ORDER BY 
      total_revenue DESC
  LIMIT 2;
"

countryWithMostSalesAndTotalRevenue <- executeQuery(mysqlCon, countryWithMostSalesAndTotalRevenueQuery)
topCountry <- countryWithMostSalesAndTotalRevenue$country[1]
topCountryRevenue <- dollar(countryWithMostSalesAndTotalRevenue$total_revenue[1])

# get second country with the most sales and total revenue
secondTopCountry <- countryWithMostSalesAndTotalRevenue$country[2]
secondCountryRevenue <- dollar(countryWithMostSalesAndTotalRevenue$total_revenue[2])
```

The year with the most sales was `r yearWithMostSales` with a total revenue across both business units of `r totalRevenueOnYearWithMostSales`. The country with the most sales was `r topCountry` with total sales across both business units in `r yearWithMostSales` of `r topCountryRevenue`. It was followed by the `r secondTopCountry` with `r secondCountryRevenue`.

The table below shows sales revenue by country and ordered by total sales for the two most recent years, `r previous_year` and `r latest_year`. The table is restricted to the top five countries with the most sales. The column 'Total' in the table represents the total for all years for which there is data and not just the past two years.

```{r revenueByCountry, echo = FALSE}
# Get revenue by country for the top 5 countries for the last two years
revenueByCountryQuery <- sprintf("

    SUM(sf.amount) as total_revenue
  FROM sales_facts sf
  JOIN dim_location dl ON sf.location_key = dl.location_key
  JOIN dim_time dt ON sf.time_key = dt.time_key
  GROUP BY dl.country
  ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
  LIMIT 5
", previous_year, latest_year)

revenueByCountry <- executeQuery(mysqlCon, revenueByCountryQuery)

# Format for display
revenueByCountry$revenue_prev_year <- dollar(revenueByCountry$revenue_prev_year)
revenueByCountry$revenue_latest_year <- dollar(revenueByCountry$revenue_latest_year)
revenueByCountry$total_revenue <- dollar(revenueByCountry$total_revenue)

# Create table
kable(revenueByCountry, 
      col.names = c("Country", previous_year, latest_year, "Total (All Years)"),
      align = c("l", "r", "r", "r"),
      caption = "Total Revenue For Top Five Countries For Most Recent Two Years") %>%

                full_width = TRUE) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, background = "#f0f0f0")
```

The table below shows the revenue broken down by quarter for the top five countries. It shows the total revenue for each quarter across all business units and years. So, for example, the column "Q1" is the total sales for music and film for all years for which there is data, which is from `r min_year` to `r max_year`.

```{r quarterlyRevenueByCountry, echo = FALSE}
# Get quarterly revenue by country for the top 5 countries
quarterlyRevenueQuery <- "
  SELECT 
    dl.country as country_name,
    SUM(CASE WHEN dt.quarter = 1 THEN sf.amount ELSE 0 END) as q1_revenue,
    SUM(CASE WHEN dt.quarter = 2 THEN sf.amount ELSE 0 END) as q2_revenue,
    SUM(CASE WHEN dt.quarter = 3 THEN sf.amount ELSE 0 END) as q3_revenue,
    SUM(CASE WHEN dt.quarter = 4 THEN sf.amount ELSE 0 END) as q4_revenue,
    AVG(sf.amount) as avg_revenue
  FROM sales_facts sf
  JOIN dim_location dl ON sf.location_key = dl.location_key
  JOIN dim_time dt ON sf.time_key = dt.time_key
  GROUP BY dl.country
  ORDER BY (q1_revenue + q2_revenue + q3_revenue + q4_revenue) DESC
  LIMIT 5

quarterlyRevenue$q4_revenue <- dollar(quarterlyRevenue$q4_revenue)
quarterlyRevenue$avg_revenue <- dollar(quarterlyRevenue$avg_revenue)

# Create column names including the year range
column_names <- c("Country", "Q1", "Q2", "Q3", "Q4", "Average")

# Create and render the table without the add_header_above function

## Customer Distribution

```{r customerCounts, echo = FALSE}
# get total customer counts and countries
customerCountQuery <- "

"
customersByBusinessUnit <- executeQuery(mysqlCon, customersByBusinessUnitQuery)
```

Across both business units, there are `r total_customers` customers in `r total_countries` different countries, with the majority of customers in `r top_country1`, `r top_country2` and `r top_country3`.

```{r customersByCountryTable, echo = FALSE}

```

## Film vs Music Revenue

Sales fluctuate over time and the table below shows total revenue per month for the years for which we have data.

```{r revenueByYear, echo = FALSE}

revenueByYear <- executeQuery(mysqlCon, revenueByYearQuery)

# Add total column
revenueByYear$total <- revenueByYear$film_revenue + revenueByYear$music_revenue

# Calculate grand totals
film_total <- sum(revenueByYear$film_revenue)
music_total <- sum(revenueByYear$music_revenue)
total_revenue <- film_total + music_total

# Add totals row
totals_row <- data.frame(
  year = "Total",
  film_revenue = film_total,
  music_revenue = music_total,
  total = total_revenue
)

revenueByYear <- rbind(revenueByYear, totals_row)

# Format for display
revenueByYear$film_revenue <- dollar(revenueByYear$film_revenue)
revenueByYear$music_revenue <- dollar(revenueByYear$music_revenue)
revenueByYear$total <- dollar(revenueByYear$total)

# Create table
kable(revenueByYear, 
      col.names = c("Year", "Film", "Music", "Total"),
      align = c("c", "r", "r", "r"),
      caption = "Revenue by year and business unit") %>%

  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, background = "#f0f0f0") %>%
  row_spec(nrow(revenueByYear), bold = TRUE, background = "#f0f0f0")
```

The graph below illustrates the quarterly growth of the film and music business over the past years for which we have data.

```{r quarterlyRevenueChart, echo = FALSE}

Based on the available data, the analysis of Media Distributors, Inc.’s film and music sales reveals a robust revenue generation pattern, with `r topCountry` and the United States emerging as the primary contributors to the company’s total sales. Between `r min_year` and `r max_year`, sales peaked in `r peak_year`, with total revenue reaching `r peak_revenue` across both business units. Film contributes `r film_percentage`% of revenue while music accounts for `r music_percentage`%.The customer base is concentrated in `r top_customer_countries`, which also serve as the top-performing markets.

Despite these strengths, Media Distributors, Inc. faces challenges related to its siloed information systems. With plans for acquisition, the company must present a cohesive and integrated business view to appeal to potential buyers. With nearly `r customer_count` customers across `r country_count` countries, Media Distributors should invest in customer relationship management (CRM) tools to personalize outreach and foster loyalty. Segmenting customers by preferences (film or music) and spending habits can optimize targeting.
